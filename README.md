I have used react, here. Firstly I have created a react project and did all the things that are needed then finally, I have made it's build using npm run build command.
After that I copied the content of build folder into the main project, I have only replaced the static folder and template ones, all other things are same. Now my fully website is working on your localhost as you wanted.
